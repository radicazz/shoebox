Project: **shoe-box** - Lightweight personal portfolio gallery

## Documentation Location
All implementation details, stack specifications, and architectural decisions are in `/docs`:

- `docs/STACK.md` - Technology stack and rationale
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Build plan, timeline, deployment
- `docs/FEATURES.md` - Feature specifications with visual mockups

## Mandatory Requirements
- Modern coding practices (ES6+, semantic HTML5, CSS Grid/Flexbox)
- Consistency across all files (naming, formatting, structure)
- Performance-first: optimize for weak server hardware
- Zero build complexity: runnable in <5 minutes on any machine

## Quick Start
1. Read `docs/STACK.md` for technology decisions
2. Review `docs/FEATURES.md` for scope and UI requirements
3. Follow `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` for execution order

**Timeline**: 2-3 days maximum
**Scope**: Personal Pinterest-style gallery board - no feature creep
